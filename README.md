:bug: Local Moodle plugin providing issue tracking for Moodle questions.

The QTracker system allows students to comment and ask questions about individual questions in a quiz. The idea and design follows the principles of issue tracker systems.

In addition to the QTracker module, an accompanying block module is needed to add the interface to a supported activity type. This block is available [here](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-block_qtracker).

The block currently supports the following activity modules:
* [Moodle Quiz](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Quiz_activity)
* [CAPQuiz](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-mod_capquiz)

## Documentation
Documentation is available [here](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-local_qtracker/wiki), including [installation instructions](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-local_qtracker/wiki/Installation-instructions).
