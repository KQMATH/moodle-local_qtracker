:bug: Local Moodle plugin providing issue tracking for Moodle questions.

The QTracker system allows students to comment and ask questions about individual questions in a quiz. The idea and design follows the principles of issue tracker systems.

In addition to the QTracker module, a separate block-type module is needed to add the interface to a given activity type. Such block modules have been made for
+ Core Quiz - [Quiz QTracker](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-block_quizqtracker)
+ CAPQuiz - [CAPQuiz QTracker](https://github.com/KQMATH/moodle-block_capquizqtracker)

The QTracker functionality is normally accessed via the appropriate block plugin.
