This local Moodle plugin provides issue tracking capabilities for Moodle questions. 

Developing questions can often be a long and tedious process. And, despite your best efforts, mistakes do happen. A question might turn out to be hard to understand, or simply contains a typo. This plugin provides a way for a user (student) to provide **feedback** to the teacher on a particular question.

QTracker provides an interface for administrating the collected issues reported by students. The student interfaces are provided in the for of [Moodle blocks](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Blocks). These are separate plugins, and needs to be developed for a particular [Moodle activity module](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Activities) using [Moodle questions](https://docs.moodle.org/39/en/Questions). This provides maximum flexibility, and ease of use!
